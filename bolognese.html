                <h1 class="title">BOLOGNESE WITH RIGATONI</h1>
                <p class="text">Is there anything more comforting than a plate full of pasta topped with bolognese? Bolognese is probably our ultimate comfort food. Not only is it comforting to eat, but it is one of those low and slow dishes that is also comforting to make. This bolognese is hearty and filled with warm flavors from the nutmeg, parmesan rind, and beef. The tomatoes, white wine, and red pepper flakes add brightness and heat that pair perfectly with the beef and warm flavors.</p>

                <p class="text">Bolognese has always held a special place in our hearts. Growing up when it came time for dinner, there was pretty much one thing we hoped to see on the counter: pasta. Over the years, not much has changed. We are still most excited when dinner time is accompanied by steaming bowls of pasta. Although we will take pasta in just about any form, rigatoni is one of our all time favorites. The noodles are thick, but the hole in the center captures the sauce perfectly. Rigatoni is the perfect thickness to give some tooth and texture and hold up to the hearty bolognese.</p>

                <h2 class="heading2">HOW TO MAKE THE BOLOGNESE:</h1>
                <p class="text">
                    To make the bolognese, start by melting butter with olive oil on medium-high heat. Once it is melted, add the onions and saute until translucent. Then add the celery and carrots and cook for 2-3 minutes until soft. Once the celery and carrots are soft, sear off the beef/pork in small chunks in a separate pan, working in batches. Once each piece is browned, add the ground beef to the carrot mixture. Break apart the beef as it cooks into small pieces. After the beef is added, turn down the temperature to low heat and add in the salt, pepper then pour in milk.
                    <br><br>Let simmer until the milk has almost entirely evaporated and then add in the red pepper flakes, freshly grated nutmeg, and parmesan rind (optional). Add the wine and let simmer until it has evaporated. After the wine is evaporated add in the tomatoes, gently breaking them apart, and the tomato paste.
                    <br><br>Leave sauce uncovered and reduce to low cooking for 3 hours. If the sauce becomes too dry throught cooking add in ½ cup of water (at the end of cooking there should be no water left). Taste and adjust for salt as needed and enjoy with your favorite 
                    pasta.</p>

                <h2 class="heading2">INGREDIENT NOTES:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><p class="text"><b>Tomatoes:</b> the best tomatoes to use for this sauce are San Marzano whole plum tomatoes. To ensure they are truly San Marzanos, look for the “D.O.P of Italy” stamp on the can. These peeled, whole San Marzano can be found in most grocery stores and make the best sauce.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="text"><b>Tomato Paste:</b> the tomato paste adds brightness and acidity to the sauce. It rounds out the tomato flavor, but due to the concentrated flavor intensifies the tomato while remaining a meat centered sauce.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="text"><b>Parmesan rind:</b> parmesan rinds should never go wasted! They add all the goodness of parmigiano reggiano within the sauce itself. Simply place a piece of a rind into the sauce while it is simmering for added depth of flavor. We also love adding the rinds in soups or while other dishes simmer for a subtle parmesan flavor. Simply add the rind during simmering and discard before serving.</p></li>
